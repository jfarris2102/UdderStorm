Welcome to the Control Room!
This will be where you handle the 
logistics of your Mars mission.

The most obvious feature of the Control Room is 
the massive "Doomsday Clock" in the upper left,
which counts down the time you have left until
the inevitable death of the earth. Hopefully 
you can successfully colonize Mars before it
reaches zero.

If you click on the technology section at the top 
of the screen, you can use "Research Points" to 
research upgrades for your buildings or the overall
mission. These upgrades should make your job a 
little easier, and have a variety of effects, such 
as unlocking upgraded buildings or increasing your income.

In the Shop menu, you can use your money to purchase 
buildings such as population centers and solar panels to 
send to Mars. When you've selected all the buildings you want, 
you can queue a rocket to launch all of your buildings to 
Mars.Once it's launched, you can view its progress in space,
and when it arrives on Mars you can construct the buildings
you purchased. Money and Research Points both renew over time
when you are not in a purchase menu.


In the bottom right of the screen there are three buttons:
To view the solar system and any recently-launched rockets,
click on the purple button.
The brown button will show you an overview of your Mars colony,
where you can place your buildings,
and the green button returns you to the Control Room.

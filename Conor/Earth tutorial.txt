Welcome to the Control Room!

In the upper left is the "Doomsday clock."
which counts down the Years:Months:Days until
the Earth becomes uninhabitable.

At the top of the screen is the technology section,
where you can use "Research Points" to research a 
variety of upgrades for your buildings or the overall
mission. 

In the Shop menu, you can purchase buildings and then 
queue a rocket to launch all of them to Mars. Once 
it arrives on Mars you can construct the buildings
you purchased. Money and Research Points both renew 
over time when you are not in a purchase menu.

In the bottom right of the screen there are three buttons:
To view the solar system and any recently-launched rockets,
click on the purple button.
The brown button will show you an overview of your Mars colony,
where you can place your buildings,
and the green button returns you to the Control Room.

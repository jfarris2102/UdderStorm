Welcome to the Martian Surface!
Here you can build your colony using 
your available buildings.

To navigate, click and drag the mouse on 
the screen. Take care not to get lost.

To start or stop building, press "S." 
To cycle between different buildings,
use the "A" and "D" keys.

When you've finished building, use the buttons 
in the bottom right to navigate back to the
Control Room to research new technologies and
launch more buildings.

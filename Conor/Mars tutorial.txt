Welcome to the Martian Surface!
Here you can build your colony using 
buildings that you have purchased and 
sent over via rocket.

To navigate, click and drag the mouse on 
the screen. Take care not to get lost.

To begin building, press "S." Then,
cycle between different building types
by pressing "A" and "D." Pressing S again
will end the building process. 
Note that certain buildings can't be constructed
unless they're adjacent to a population center.

When you've finished building, use the buttons 
in the bottom right to navigate back to the
Control Room to research new technologies and
launch more buildings.

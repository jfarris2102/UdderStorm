Dawson Kelly- 2/20-2/27

2/21: We met at the Redwood Grove lounge and planned out our following weeks 
and the deadlines to come.  We also coded a few things, I created the basis 
for the earth view section of the game.  

2/22-2/24: Finished as much of the earth view as possible with the current state 
of the game.  

2/26: We met for 4 hours in the 109 Jack Baskin lounge and I was able to update 
my earth view section to accommodate other parts of code.  I also created a bottom menu. 

2/27: We worked on putting our game together and bringing all of our different .js 
files together. I scrapped my bottom menu and used part of the code to create a side 
menu that was not on a separate canvas. Our tile engine, main menu, side menu, 
earthview etc. were all put together and work somewhat as imagined.

We have a lot of our game done and it is mostly finished.  
There are a few specific points that need to be fleshed out.  
These include linking our dooooomsday algorithm and fixing a few basic errors.  
These will be fixed by monday for certain.  We also are using lots of temporary 
sprites that will be polished by the game showing date. 

I created all of our temporary sprites this week.
I also was the one to fix and implement the rest of the resources into the HUD sidebar.  
Finally just general help around on the program and idea building stuff.

Conor Mahoney- 2/20-2/27

2/21: Meeting at Redwood Grove to discuss deadlines and revise and finish the 
design process. Spent 3 hours creating pseudo-code for the playable game’s tile 
engine. Additionally, we distributed various tasks to each group member.

2/22-2/25: Created a simple tile engine for the game that allows for drawing each visible 
grid in the engine. Implements mouse-based click and drag movement for the game.

2/26: Met for 3 hours in JBaskin 109 to finish programming the tile engine and interface 
it with resource management and building systems. Worked with Niklas to convert the tile engine 
to a brine-based system and combat the huge latency initially produced by that change.

2/27: Worked for two hours to finish the playable prototype for submission, including 
combining the tile engine with

Overall, we worked to finalize our game by patching together our different view windows and 
adding content to the building system and the overall game mechanics.
 
While the majority of the game takes part in the mars view, we followed the original plan of 
having three separate views, which each represent a different part of the mission, and allow the 
player different options and information
 
3/5: Worked on the Martian surface, to change terrain spawn rates and create harsher terrain tiles,
defined as blockedTiles, upon which building was impossible.
 
3/6: Made several last minute changes to the game’s organization and documentation, 
including program comments and progress documentation.

Niklas Carlson- 2/20-2/27

2/21: Group met at Redwood Grove to discuss deadlines and revise and finish the 
design process. Later on designed and implemented the main menu using photoshop.

2/22-2/25:  Designed some sprites to be used in the 2/27 prototype.

2/26: Met for 3 hours in JBaskin 109 to finish programming the tile engine and 
interface it with resource management and building systems. Worked with Conor to 
convert the tile engine to a brine-based system and combat the huge latency initially 
produced by that change.

2/26-2/27: Modified Conor’s tile engine to implement/modify features such as building 
placement, view dragging, and various other tweaks and optimizations.

2/27: Worked for several hours to finalize the playable prototype for submission. 
Specifically linking all game states and menus together.

Niklas Carlson - 2/28-3/6
Finished mosts tasks, implemented tech, shop, terminal sprites, earth sprites, 
doomsday graphics, text displays, mars code updates, various tweaks, and bugfixes. 
Also added solar view and orbital timeframe as well as improved menu navigation.

Justin Farris 2/20-2/27

Established global variables for resources and buildings and determined each 
building’s functions.

Developed resource generation algorithms based on building types and amounts, according to our game 
time - real time relationshipIntegrated javascript files in order to properly generate resources based 
on building placement, and to properly update the resource display accordingly

General finalization of the prototype

Justin Farris - 2/28 -3/6

Fully solidified a tech tree 
Completed the algorithm to calculate the remaining lifetime of earth
Completed resource updates based on current levels of all buildings
Recorded some music to be edited and eventually added to the game

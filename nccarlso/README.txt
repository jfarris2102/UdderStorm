Weekly Log for February 28- March 6 Team UdderStorm
 
 
 Dawson Kelly-

We have a lot of our game done and it is mostly finished.  There are a few specific points that need to be fleshed out.  These include linking our dooooomsday algorithm and fixing a few basic errors.  These will be fixed by monday for certain.  We also are using lots of temporary sprites that will be polished by the game showing date. 

I created all of our temporary sprites this week.
I also was the one to fix and implement the rest of the resources into the HUD sidebar.  
Finally just general help around on the program and idea building stuff.

Overall, we worked to finalize our game by patching together our different view windows and adding content to the building system and the overall game mechanics.
 
While the majority of the game takes part in the mars view, we followed the original plan of having three separate views, which each represent a different part of the mission, and allow the player different options and information
 
3/5: Worked on the Martian surface, to change terrain spawn rates and create harsher terrain tiles,
defined as blockedTiles, upon which building was impossible.
 
3/6: Made several last minute changes to the game’s organization and documentation, including program comments and progress documentation.
